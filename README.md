Not Another Dating App, is a dating website developed to tackle the unconventional ways of online dating.

NADA is a dating app designed to create organic connections through conversations rather than based on a persons image. 

Having seen and heard about persons experience on different websites, we wanted to do something different, where individuals can create meaningful connections. Thinking about it, we could have swiped left on an individual with a great personality, if we are "judging a book by its cover". 

Instead we want you to get to know the person first, and make decisions not based solely on a portrayal of who they are, based on an image.

The contributors to this project are Ashanique Moore and Dachanelle Anderson.

### Description: What is it?
NADA (Not Another Dating App) is a dating website catered to facilitating organic connections through meaningful conversations. Unlike other platforms, NADA is taking an unconventional approach by using words written by the user to be the first thing seen rather than an image of the user.

### Problem: What problem is this solving?
Dating apps and online dating through observation and personal use tend to all have one specific thing in common, “a superficial aspect” to whom one connects with. Dating apps don’t need to be only about finding a romantic soulmate; they can also be about platonic friendships, new experiences, and even breaking relationship norms. Seeing how a person looks emphasizes their physical appearance rather than who they are and what they value. This is the issue NADA is looking to solve. Taking away that physical layer and replacing it with short biographies will give an insight into who that person is and ultimately create organic connections on a leveled ground. Because who can’t honestly say they may have swiped left on their soulmate?

### Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
From a personal experience and from those of friends, we experimented with different platforms, and having seen each user's profile; we instinctively swiped right or left based on what was seen and not what was written. Many users on the platform don’t even take the time to update their bio to give others an insight into who they are at a glance away from what is portrayed in their images. If the photos were hidden, then biographies would be emphasized, ultimately shifting the perspective from what a user sees to what the users read.

### Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
The application's success can be measured through various metrics these can include user experience, user traffic, user interaction, how often a user decides to engage with the platform features and other users, and even more, how often a picture reveal hinders or promotes the users' interaction.

### Audience: Who are we building for?
The targetted audience would be adults 18+ and up.
** What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product? **
It will be a dating application with standard swipe left and right features, chat options that will include an interactive like option which will give the user a picture reveal button after giving three “hearts” (likes). Profile, login and sign up features with authentication.
